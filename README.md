# Eniac_Discount_Category_Analysis

Project objectives & overview: Eniac is an ecommerce company specialising in tech products sales. Using data analysis tools, they would like to investigate whether or not it would be beneficial to provide discount on their product range to boost sales and subsequently increase revenue. Hier Eniac's Marketing Team is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run, on the other hand the main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts.

Project tasks:
We as a team of three Data scientists were given following concrete tasks to investigate:

How products should be classified into different categories in order to simplify reports and analysis.
What is the distribution of product prices across different categories.
How many products are being discounted.
How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices.
How seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales.
How could data collection be improved.
Analysis:
Data appears to have inconsistencies(no categorization, missing values, 3 decimals present) --> Data cleaning technique applied
Absence of buyer retetion information
Historical price changes for the products unavailable
Country/area specific discount info incomplete
Results:
Based on provided facts and data, we were able to generate overview of Eniac's products sales pattern
per month
per category
on strategic time points of the year
graphical representation of above analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn
We were able to provide final conclusion whether and when should Eniac provide discounts over the year to achieve their sales goal.
